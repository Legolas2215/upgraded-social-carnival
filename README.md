# Social Media Clone



This is a social media clone web application built using React as frontend, Node.js as backend, and MongoDB as the database.

Your README file is normally the first entry point to your code. It should tell people why they should use your module, how they can install it, and how they can use it. Standardizing how you write your README makes creating and maintaining your READMEs easier. Great documentation takes work!
